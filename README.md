# Vehicle Tracking &amp; Traffic Analysis | Computer Vision Project (Speed and Traffic intensity Estimation)

## üåê Overview
This project implements a **vehicle tracking**, **speed estimation** and traffic intensity system using the YOLO object detection model and the Supervision library. The implementation is built on a Roboflow's Supervision library , which provides tools for object detection and tracking. The project has gone through several stages of development, each aimed at improving accuracy, stability, and functionality.

## Features
- **Vehicle Detection:** Uses YOLO for real-time object detection.
- **Object Tracking:** ByteTrack ensures smooth tracking across frames.
- **Speed Estimation:** Calculates vehicle speed based on positional changes over time.
- **Noise Reduction:** Implements Kalman filters and smoothing techniques to stabilize speed calculations.
- **Traffic Analysis:** Tracks the number of vehicles moving up/down and classifies traffic intensity.
- **Visualization:** Displays vehicle count, speed, and traffic status in a user-friendly format.

## Project Stages
### 1. Initial Implementation (Roboflow Tutorial-Based)
- Implemented vehicle tracking based on [Supervision's Roboflow tutorial](https://supervision.roboflow.com/how_to/track_objects/).
- Estimated speed using the first and last position of vehicles in a deque.
- **Issue:** Inaccurate results due to overlapping bounding boxes when multiple vehicles appeared in the same frame.

### 2. Improved Speed Detection
- Enhanced speed stability using:
  - **Smoothing functions:** Moving average and exponential smoothing.
  - **Kalman Filter:** Reduces noise and fluctuations in speed estimation.
  - **Increased deque size:** Stores more frames for better averaging.
  - **Multiple points for speed calculation:** Provides more reliable estimations.
- **Result:** More consistent and stable speed display.

### 3. Vehicle Counting and Traffic Intensity Analysis
- Implemented vehicle counting logic for detecting vehicles moving **up** and **down**.
- Displayed real-time traffic intensity using threshold-based classification:
  - **Low Traffic:** Green (‚â§ 5 vehicles/min)
  - **Moderate Traffic:** Yellow (‚â§ 15 vehicles/min)
  - **Heavy Traffic:** Red (> 15 vehicles/min)

## How It Works
1. **YOLO detects vehicles** in each frame.
2. **ByteTrack assigns tracking IDs** to detected vehicles.
3. **Position data is stored** for each vehicle.
4. **Speed is calculated** using the change in position over time.
5. **Speed smoothing is applied** (moving average, exponential smoothing, and Kalman filter).
6. **Vehicle movement is analyzed**, counting those moving up or down.
7. **Traffic intensity is classified** and displayed on the video output.
